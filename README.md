A Better Way to Contract.

#### Problem: 
Each contractor and government agency typically has its own contracting website, creating a myriad of problems, like low visibility for smaller 
and newer contracting companies, loads of govt websites for contractors looking for work to dig through, and a lack of standardization.

#### Solution: 
Our application offers a simple way for governments to offer contracts and compare bids, and for contractors to filter through contracts 
by industry. Through user verification, reviews, and buyer/seller ratings, we ensure security and transparency for both governments and
contractors.

Note to team
If u dont like this idea, the fields and class names can easily be changed for a more basic app like ebay or whatever
