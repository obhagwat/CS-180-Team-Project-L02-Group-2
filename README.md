A Better Way to Contract.

#### Problem: 
Each contracting company and government agency typically has its own contracting website, creating a myriad of problems. Smaller, newer contracing
companies face high entry barriers, while governments waste their efforts digging through bids. A lack of standardization creates confusion for 
soliciting agencies as each bid often follows a different format, while contractors need to dig through loads of different government websites to find
contracts they can bid on. 

#### Solution: 
Our application will offer a simple way for governments to solicit contracts and compare bids, for contractors to filter through contracts 
by industry, and for both to easily keep track of project information, past and present. Through user verification, reviews, and buyer/seller ratings,
we ensure security and transparency for both governments and
contractors.

Note to team: If u dont like this idea, the fields and class names can easily be changed for a more basic app like ebay or whatever
